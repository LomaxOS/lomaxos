👋 My name is Lomax OS. I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a strong work ethic. I enjoy problem-solving and working with technology. I don't stay in one place for years; instead, I make big moves, akin to the Queen piece in chess. (Don't mind my violation of DRY principle below with "I am")
👀 I am interested in leadership, Kaizen, software development lifecycle, software Engineering and Project management.
🌱 I am growing like a Baobab tree in te field of Software Engineering
💞️ I am striving for personal development to excel in this industry.
