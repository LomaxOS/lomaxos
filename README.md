- 👋 My name is Lomax OS. I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a strong work ethic. I enjoy problem-solving and working with technology. I don't stay in one place for years; instead, I make big moves, akin to the Queen piece in chess. (Excuse my violation of DRY principle below with "I am")
- 👀 I am interested in leadership, continuous improvement, excellence, SDLC, SDE, and PM.
- 🌱 I am growing like a Baobab tree in te field of Software Engineering
- 💞️ I am striving for personal development and to become disciplined professionally.
- ✨ I am committed to becoming the best.
