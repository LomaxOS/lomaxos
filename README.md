- 👋 Hi, I'm Lomax Osomba, a great kid of his mum; I love programming. I have a highly productive work ethic and remember that there is no outstanding achievement without hard work. I'm self-motivated and very enthusiastic in any domain I find interesting.
     #I believe while life is still true, learning never ends. 
- 👀 I’m interested in object-oriented programming, full stack development, database design and development, and data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m completing a bachelor of science (Honours) course in computing with software development at MTU Kerry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with innovative and enthusiastic developers to develop scalable, easy-to-maintain software products with clean codes that reveal intent.
